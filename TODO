TODO:

finish:
  for beta version:
    documentation (examples)
      nested tuplets example
    better error messages when wrong type of value is input (like a list for a pitch)
    trills on chords?
    enharmonic tremolos
    sal062 causes problem when multithreads are on
    point durations that are too long
  later:
    compressed XML file
    marks shouldn't conflict with vocal text
    harp pedals
    fret diagrams
    allow modules to ask whether or not it's already processed a note event (for on-the-fly module switching, only a few need this)
    default instruments w/ assigned perc-inst groups
    vars to store time, etc.
    default instrument abbreviations
    a way to put groups of notes in same voice w/o specifying the voice
    better Pd example
    unify error processing (look for active module, then look for active fomusdata struct)
    breath marks before very first note

bugs:
  tutorial 4.7 and 4.8 parts are in wrong order
  single notes get attached w/ a secondary beam (remove the beam)
  layouts don't work when instruments are used as templates--need extra setting that identifies the instrument
  Emacs mode `part' inside structures doesn't get highlighted
  Emacs mode `-' or `+' in front of mark is highlighted wrong

backend issues:
  LilyPond:
    polymeters
    grace note slashes only attach to single note
  MusicXML:
    Finale:
      extra full measure rests created if there is only one voice
      rests that should be invisible aren't (appear as more extra rests)
      rests go on wrong staves (the staff number is ignored)
      multi-note tremolos aren't imported
    Sibelius:
      nested tuplets don't important correctly
      clefs are ignored

features:
  more percussion instruments
  more instruments (other than orchestral ones)
  pitch ranges for deciding voices
  complex meters (including fractional durations and compound meters)

internal:
  go through all #warnings in code
  cleanup code
