0.1.18-alpha

	* libfomus: fixed erroneous measure integrity check
	* libfomus: improvements in module scheduling
	* untie: new module that removes ties from notes, resulting in
	  unconventional but easier-to-read notation
	* libfomus: added main library support needed for `untie' module
	  (module still needs to be written)
	* markgrps: fixed bug causing mark groups (e.g., `pizz' and
	  `arco') to appear incorrectly in tied notes across measure
	  boundaries
	* grslurs: fixed bug causing mysterious slurs to appear over notes
	  when FOMUS determines note durations
	* libfomus: fixed bug causing rests in invisible voices (created
	  by mark events, for example) to be notated incorrectly when
	  there are tuplets in other voices (and causing LilyPond output
	  to crash with an error)
	* lilyout: actual accidentals are output when `lily-autoaccs' is
	  set to a non-empty value (letting LilyPond decide how to notate
	  them)

	  change signs (and other potential problems)
	* fomus.el: fixed a few annoying warnings that pop up in new
	  version of emacs

	  string when it's the first character

	  monophonic line

	  can now be easily sent to all parts
	* libfomus: fixed obscure bug that caused copied FOMUS data
	  instances to use the default part of the copied instance

	  `xml-suppress-acctag'), also option to map accidentals to
	  arbitrary strings for <alter> tag
	* libfomus: accidentals larger than double sharps/flats allowed
	  now (output module needs to know what to do with non-standard
	  accidentals)
	* lilyout: fixed protection of DOS command-line arguments with
	  quotes when starting a process in windows and using one of DOS's
	  command-line delimiters (why should I have to do this?)
	* libfomus: incorrect nested lists in Lisp/SAL caused segfault
	  instead of an error message (not any more)
	* divrules: now prevents user from specifying single "whole"
	  metrical division, causing FOMUS to search infinitely for a
	  valid division
	* libfomus: `clip' accepts rationals like it should

	  situations)
	* divrules: fixed an issue having to do with how `meas-divs'

	* lilyout: fixed LilyPond-specific error involving incorrect clef
	  signatures in output
	* beams: some notation corrections
	* libfomus: fixed bug in how FOMUS calculates time signatures in
	  compound meter (caused by an earlier bug fix)
	* percchs: eliminated redundant `perc-change' setting
